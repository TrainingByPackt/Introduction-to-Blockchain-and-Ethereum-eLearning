# Introduction to Blockchain and Ethereum eLearning
Blockchain applications provide a single-shared ledger to eliminate trust issues involving multiple stakeholders.
With the help of Introduction to Blockchain and Ethereum, you'll learn how to create distributed Blockchain applications which do not depend on a central server or datacenter. The course begins by explaining Bitcoin, Altcoins, and Ethereum, followed by taking you through distributed programming using the Solidity language on the Ethereum Blockchain.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to write, compile, and deploy your own smart contracts to the Ethereum Blockchain.



## What you will learn
* Grasp Blockchain concepts such as private and public keys, addresses, wallets, and hashes
* Send and analyze transactions in the Ethereum Rinkeby test network
* Compile and deploy your own ERC20-compliant smart contracts and tokens
* Test your smart contracts using MyEtherWallet
* Create a distributed web interface for your contract
* Combine Solidity and JavaScript to create your very own decentralized application



### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: Intel Core i3 processor or equivalent
* **Memory**: 2 GB RAM (1.5 GB if running on a virtual machine)
* **Hard disk**: 10 GB available hard disk space
* 5400 RPM hard disk drive
* DirectX 9-capable video card (1024 x 768 or higher resolution)
* An Internet connection



### Software requirements
Youâ€™ll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Operating System: Windows 8 or higher(64-bit version)
* Browser: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox (latest updates installed)
* [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/)
* [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/)
Access to installation instructions can be provided separately to course material for large training centers and organizations. All source code is publicly available on GitHub and fully referenced within the training material.
